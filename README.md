# Lock-The-Lost
An Android Application designed to secure your phone when you accidently drop it while riding a moto-bike or on a run or cycling for fitness.
In most of the cases people drop their phone without knowing it until they reach their destination. i.e. their home or office.
In between time before they realize they dropped their phone and they track it down, someone pickup the phone and 1st thing they do is power it off so that owner will not able
to track it later. The main purpose of our application is not to disturb the flow but to fake it down so that bad intended person will not feel the change. 
My application "LOCK THE LOST" is compactible to detect the fall and able to fake the shutdown process and meanwhile turn on GPS service and Mobile Data so that user will able 
to locate it later. The quality of my application is that it will never fake these process if you intentionally drop your phone for testing :) . 
[Phone must be Rooted for fake shutdown process]
